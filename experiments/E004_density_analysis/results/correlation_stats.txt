E004 — Correlation Test Results
================================
Date: 2026-02-23
Total sites analyzed: 383
Distance bins with data: 7

Spearman rho (density vs distance from volcano): -0.9550
p-value: 0.000806

Interpretation:
rho = -0.955, p = 0.0008. H1 NOT SUPPORTED at p < 0.05. No positive trend.

MVR: rho > 0.5 and p < 0.05
MVR NOT MET

H1 (Taphonomic Bias): NOT SUPPORTED

Notes:
- This is a distance-based proxy for volcanic deposition.
  A stronger test would use actual tephra thickness estimates (E002 data).
- OSM site data is known to be incomplete. Undercounting is expected.
- Sites without coordinates are excluded (383 geocoded out of full dataset).
