E005 - H1 Residual Test (Terrain Suitability-Controlled)
=========================================================
Date: 2026-02-23
Study area: Malang Raya (PILOT - limited extent)
Grid size: 25km x 25km
Total grid cells analyzed: 12
Sites in study area: 43

Method: Spearman correlation between:
  - residual site density (observed - terrain-predicted)
  - distance to nearest active volcano

Spearman rho: -0.1818
p-value: 0.571701

rho = -0.182, p = 0.5717. H1 NOT SUPPORTED: No deficit of sites near volcanoes after controlling for terrain.

H1 status: NOT SUPPORTED / INCONCLUSIVE

IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
1. Study area limited to Malang Raya (pilot). Full East Java analysis needed.
2. Suitability model is simplified (slope + elevation + TWI proxy).
   No actual river distance data, no soil quality, no aspect.
3. River proximity uses TWI as proxy - may inflate suitability in upland areas.
4. Site data is sparse in this area (major sites are concentrated in Brantas valley
   just outside the Malang Raya DEM extent).
5. TWI computation uses simplified contributing area proxy, not true flow accumulation.
