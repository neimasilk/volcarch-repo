E005 Step 2 — Full Jawa Timur H1 Test
======================================
Date: 2026-02-23
DEM: Copernicus GLO-30 (30m), full Jawa Timur
Grid size: 25km x 25km
Total grid cells analyzed: 187
Total sites: 391

Spearman rho (residual density vs distance to volcano): -0.3584
p-value: 0.000000

rho = -0.358, p = 0.0000. H1 NOT SUPPORTED: No deficit of sites near volcanoes after controlling for terrain.

H1 (Taphonomic Bias): NOT SUPPORTED / INCONCLUSIVE

Suitability model weights:
  Slope:     0.4
  Elevation: 0.3
  TWI:       0.2
  River prox:0.1  (TWI proxy)

Notes:
- River proximity uses TWI as proxy (future: replace with actual river distance raster)
- Null model assumes site density proportional to terrain suitability (simplistic)
- Discovery bias (survey coverage) not controlled for
- Results should be interpreted alongside E004 findings
